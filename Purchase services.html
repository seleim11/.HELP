                                <h1>Who are the hacker ?</h1>
                                <p>A Hacker is someone who can find vulnerabilities in computers or computer networks to penetrate them and access the stored information. They are often professional programmers with high skills in their field, with prior knowledge of computer programs. Hackers are "ambiguous" individuals who stand in a border zone between black hat and white hat hackers. In some cases, they may assist you, while in others, you may become their next target. In general, the word describes someone specialized and proficient in computer and information security skills. The term hacker was originally coined for a group of intelligent programmers who challenged various systems and attempted to breach them. It's not necessarily their intention to commit a crime or even an offense, but their success in breaching is considered a testament to their abilities and skills. However, the law considers them intruders who managed to enter a virtual place where they should not be. Engaging in hacking is an optional process in which the programmer tests their abilities without revealing their true identity or announcing themselves. Nevertheless, some exploit it criminally for destructive purposes, wiping out information, while others exploit it commercially for espionage purposes or monetary theft.

                                <h1>List of hacker types ?</h1>
                                <p>White Hat hackers: Although hacking is generally considered criminal and unauthorized, i.e., illegal, there are exceptions. This type of hackers assist individuals and companies in eliminating viruses and malicious software.</p>
                                <p>Most of these hackers or white hat pirates hold a university degree either in Information Security or Computer Science. Those working in this profession usually possess a necessary certification, with the most common certification in the field being the Certified Ethical Hacker from the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council).</p>
                                <p>Black Hats: As commonly known, they are the hackers we hear about in the news, who exploit security weaknesses in banks, financial institutions, and other companies to steal money or private data such as credit card information. They possess a variety of programming skills and languages.</p>
                                <p>Grey Hats: The individual who gains unauthorized access but discloses weaknesses to the company. In one way or another, these hackers are neither criminals nor ethical. They don't engage in activities such as stealing money, for example, nor do they necessarily assist people (although they might if they wanted to).</p>
                                <p>Script Kiddie: A person who lacks technical skills and merely uses pre-made tools or readily available software.</p>
                                <p>Hacktivist: The individual who infiltrates systems to promote certain ideas and leaves messages on specific subjects, such as religious or political messages, or messages opposing copyright laws.</p>

                                <h1>What is the difference between information security and cyber security ?</h1>
                                <p>Firstly, what is information security or cybersecurity?</p>
                                <p>Information security is one of the most important fields in our present time. It's a science that is rapidly evolving, and I am completely sure that when you hear this term, your mind goes to hackers targeting devices, accounts, banks, and more... But hold on right there, my dear friend, because this assumption is not true at all.</p>
                                <p>Second: What is cybersecurity</p>
                                <p>It's certainly something significant and eye-catching when you hear the word "cyber." However, dear friend, you can replace the word "cyber" with "electronic," meaning that cybersecurity is the same as "electronic security."</p>
                                <p>Electronic security encompasses everything related to electronics. This includes the security of your washing machine at home, your television where you watch your favorite shows and programs, your car that you drive, the radio you listen to, and every electronic device. However, the types of electronics vary from one device to another, which is why their protections also differ.</p>
